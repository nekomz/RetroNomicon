# RetroNomicon
A Discord theme made for retro fans and fun

Feel free to use it, leave feedback and suggest new features!
For the best results, **use the dark theme**.

Designed by *Romzelized*, But Using GH Template of *Thee Yandere Chan* ; latest version: **1.0**.

# Dynamic Import
Paste this link in your Custom CSS section if you want to
dynamically load the theme without having to download any files.

```css
/* IMPORT CSS FROM GITHUB */

/* Load Base theme */
//Thanks Yan-Chan ;3
@import url("https://cdn.rawgit.com/THEEYandereChan/Simplicity/master/mods/UserPopoutsUpgraded.theme.css");
@import url("https://github.com/nekomz/RetroNomicon/master/themes/Retronomicon.theme.css");
```
Oh, and if that didn't work, you can just copy paste the content of https://cdn.rawgit.com/THEEYandereChan/Simplicity/master/mods/UserPopoutsUpgraded.theme.css
and put that in your custom CSS.
